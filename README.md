### Hi there! 👋

<!--
**calcmaster7/calcmaster7** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 👻⠀Hi! I'm @calcmaster7
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I’m a cyber security engineer , ethical hacker, and software developer
     who wants to write his own exploits instead of running someone else's 
- 😈 I'm interested in building hacker tools, writing exploits, and reverse engineering
- 🤖 I also enjoy systems programming and writing web applications. After all To attack a system,
     you should a bit of experience building them, in my opinion.
- 🔒 You might find a few miscelaneous projects posted here as well
